3	Lisa Simpson	That life is worth living.
7	Bart Simpson	Victory party under the slide!
10	Lisa Simpson	Do you know where I could find him?
14	Lisa Simpson	I see he touched you, too.
15	Bart Simpson	Hey, thanks for your vote, man.
17	Bart Simpson	Well, you got that right.
20	Milhouse Van Houten	Uh oh.
26	Bart Simpson	No.
34	Lisa Simpson	Oh, I mean, were you just going to leave, just like that?
36	Lisa Simpson	You can't go! You're the best teacher I'll ever have.
38	Lisa Simpson	Oh, please.
40	Lisa Simpson	But I need you too.
47	Lisa Simpson	Nothing.
55	Lisa Simpson	Oh.
56	Homer Simpson	He's gone. Forever.
57	Lisa Simpson	And?
58	Homer Simpson	I didn't think you'd understand.
59	Lisa Simpson	Me?
63	Lisa Simpson	I don't think you realize what you're saying.
65	Lisa Simpson	Go Away.
71	Lisa Simpson	Nuts.
72	Homer Simpson	This isn't going well at all.
73	Homer Simpson	Look, if you just want me to forgive you --
74	Lisa Simpson	No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say.
77	Marge Simpson	Children, it's time for you to go to bed.
78	Homer Simpson	Yeah.
79	Marge Simpson	I can hold these nails in place with my tail.
81	Lisa Simpson	You're so silly.
82	Homer Simpson	Gimme a banana.
83	Lisa Simpson	I don't have any banana.
84	Homer Simpson	Come on, you're holding out on me.
86	Homer Simpson	Think nothing of it.
87	Lisa Simpson	Hey, what's the matter, son?
89	Homer Simpson	Would you have to do extra work?
90	Bart Simpson	Well, no.
93	Homer Simpson	Hey! Thanks, monkey-man.
96	Bart Simpson	Sleep well, Maggie. Ah, three for three.
97	Homer Simpson	Homie, did you straighten everything out...?
98	Bart Simpson	Mmm... hors doovers.
99	Homer Simpson	Homer! You promised!
100	Homer Simpson	I promised I wouldn't eat? Never! You lie!
101	Homer Simpson	Yeah, you can't have any fun in bed.
102	Marge Simpson	Oh son, when you're older, you'll know better.
104	Homer Simpson	Hmmm. Oh, baby! Mmmm. Yeah.
105	Marge Simpson	Oh! They're here! How does everything look?
106	Homer Simpson	How do I look?
109	Bart Simpson	Do we have enough glasses?
110	Homer Simpson	Do we have enough gag ice cubs?
111	Homer Simpson	Homer! Homer! Put a record on!
112	Marge Simpson	What are all our friends names again?
113	Homer Simpson	Children! Go!
114	Marge Simpson	College boy.
115	Homer Simpson	Hey, Homer! Care to try some of my Flanders Planters punch?
116	Marge Simpson	Why not? I paid for it.
117	Homer Simpson	Oh, Dr. Hibbert. Enjoying the party?
118	Marge Simpson	It was me! You fell for it!
120	Moe Szyslak	Please Dad.
121	Ned Flanders	You should see the look on your face. It's priceless.
127	Homer Simpson	What?
131	Homer Simpson	You little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?
133	Homer Simpson	Yes sir.
136	Homer Simpson	That thing you know how to do.
137	Homer Simpson	Go to bed.
138	Bart Simpson	Hey, everybody! Look, I'm the funniest guy in the world!
139	Homer Simpson	All right then.
141	Homer Simpson	Not those peanuts. The ones at the bottom.
142	Bart Simpson	I must apologize for my husband.
144	Bart Simpson	Remember, I said if.
145	Homer Simpson	I have never been so embarrassed in my life.
146	Homer Simpson	Why? What'd you do?
152	Homer Simpson	Marge!
153	Homer Simpson	Come here!
155	Homer Simpson	Where-where are we going?
157	Marge Simpson	Shhh.
159	Marge Simpson	They're fighting in the car again.
160	Dr. Julius Hibbert	That music always sends a chill down my spine.
161	Marge Simpson	The way I acted?
162	Homer Simpson	I put it there.
163	Homer Simpson	I slipped it into your glass as a gag.
164	Marge Simpson	I'm sorry, honey. Can't we just forget it and go to church.
165	Homer Simpson	No, I didn't... I... Oh, you mean inside, don't you?
166	Marge Simpson	I understand why. You were wasted.
168	Bart Simpson	Aw.
174	Homer Simpson	Hmmmm.
176	Homer Simpson	Oh, well, it's very tempting. Really a wonderful idea.
183	Homer Simpson	We'll be there!
185	Bart Simpson	Marriage encounter weekend, here I come!
188	Homer Simpson	Now you wanna go?
190	Homer Simpson	Oh, that must be the babysitter.
192	Homer Simpson	Hello. I'm Mrs. Simpson.
196	Homer Simpson	Come back for more, eh?
199	Homer Simpson	Mom! You wouldn't dare.
200	Homer Simpson	No, you don't!
202	Homer Simpson	Huh... who?... what?
203	Bart Simpson	Grampa, could you do something?
206	Marge Simpson	I can dress myself.
207	Marge Simpson	Marge, just puttin' a few last things in the trunk.
209	Bart Simpson	Just give me the list. I can read.
213	Lisa Simpson	Call this number if Grampa falls in the bathtub.
215	Homer Simpson	I heard that.
216	Marge Simpson	Uh huh .. Uh-huh... You're allowed smoke cigars?
217	Grampa Simpson	Hmmm, bait.
218	Marge Simpson	Whoa, better get some gas.
219	Grampa Simpson	Fill 'er up. I guess I'll go and stretch my legs.
222	Homer Simpson	Catfish Lake.
224	Grampa Simpson	Oh yeah.
226	Marge Simpson	Whoa, who says that?
230	Homer Simpson	None of your business, Flanders.
231	Homer Simpson	I see. I also understand bowling expressions.
232	Homer Simpson	Well...
234	Homer Simpson	Lucky you don't keep guns in the house.
238	Homer Simpson	Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her dress.
240	Homer Simpson	She's perfect.
242	Homer Simpson	Well, sometimes that can be annoying.
244	Homer Simpson	Oh, Homer.
249	Marge Simpson	I'm done.
252	Homer Simpson	It's true. It's all true.
255	Homer Simpson	Sorry.
257	Homer Simpson	I only did that a couple of times.
276	Ned Flanders	Half a gallon of chocolate.
279	Homer Simpson	Check.
281	Homer Simpson	Half a gallon of chocolate brownie fudge.
283	Homer Simpson	Did your Mom really write that shopping list?
286	Marge Simpson	What's next, Lis?
288	Homer Simpson	Sprinkles and syrup.
295	Homer Simpson	Well, all right, but put out that cigar.
297	Homer Simpson	You know, kids, it's gettin' pretty late.
298	Lisa Simpson	Yeah, you should go to bed, Grampa. We've had a big day.
299	Bart Simpson	It's no use kidding myself. I'm having an ethical crisis.
300	Lisa Simpson	Would this be a good time to be honest?
301	Bart Simpson	Yes.
303	Bart Simpson	Get back in bed.
304	Grampa Simpson	All right. But I can't sleep. Can I take a walk?
305	Lisa Simpson	Sure.
306	Bart Simpson	Hey, kid! You forgot your... WHOA!
307	Lisa Simpson	Homer?
308	Bart Simpson	Sugar?
314	Bart Simpson	Are you sure your ma lets you kids drink coffee?
315	Lisa Simpson	For the last time, yes!
318	Homer Simpson	Good! Give up!
319	Marge Simpson	Huh?
322	Homer Simpson	Do I have to do this?
323	Homer Simpson	Over there / Send the word / Send the word / Over there.
324	Marge Simpson	That the Yanks are comin'...
326	Homer Simpson	Whoa! Holy mackerel!
329	Grampa Simpson	Not yet, but the afternoon is young.
331	Bart Simpson	You're great at a party, Lisa. Really great.
332	Grampa Simpson	OW!
333	Bart Simpson	Haw haw haw!
334	Homer Simpson	You young hellion, do you want me to take off my belt?
335	Homer Simpson	All right. I'll show you.
337	Milhouse Van Houten	Haw! Haw! Haw!
341	Marge Simpson	Doggone it!
343	Grampa Simpson	I love you, but I must kill you.
344	Grampa Simpson	Ah, thanks, it's your dad's.
346	Homer Simpson	Well, how do you make this feeling go away?
347	Bart Simpson	Uh, oh.
349	Bart Simpson	Hi, honey. Uh, oh. How's the marriage retreat going?
350	Bart Simpson	To who?
352	Bart Simpson	To those weirdos in the worm store.
354	Grampa Simpson	All this fish represents is just how selfish you are.
355	Nelson Muntz	Well, if that's the way you feel... I'll throw it back.
356	Grampa Simpson	Oh yeah, sure.
357	Nelson Muntz	Watch.
358	Grampa Simpson	Ohhh, Homer.
359	Nelson Muntz	We're back!
360	Grampa Simpson	How's your marriage?
361	Homer Simpson	Same as usual. Perfectomundo.
367	Bart Simpson	I'll never trust another old person.
370	Homer Simpson	I fooled you. So long suckers. Hee hee hee.
371	Homer Simpson	Hey, they do look alike!
376	Homer Simpson	He's no wittier than the next superhero.
377	Marge Simpson	I stand corrected.
378	Homer Simpson	We're here!
379	Marge Simpson	This looks like a discount for...
384	Lisa Simpson	Hey, Otto-man! Oooh, what's that?
385	Homer Simpson	Cool!
390	Grampa Simpson	Yep.
402	Marge Simpson	I bet it's worth a million bucks!
406	Lisa Simpson	So, did you kids have fun?
407	Marge Simpson	Ohhh.
410	Bart Simpson	All right, what are you getting at?
420	Bart Simpson	Are you?
423	Bart Simpson	Okay.
425	Bart Simpson	Haw haw!
429	Bart Simpson	Uh... nothing.
448	Bart Simpson	I NEED SOME MONEY / A LOT OF MONEY... AHH
450	Bart Simpson	Empty bottles... empty bottles...
454	Marge Simpson	Hm... well, it's practically empty.
458	Marge Simpson	No, not today. I need the dime.
461	Homer Simpson	Oh, it is good to see you are learning a trade.
462	Bart Simpson	Ah-ha!
465	Homer Simpson	Americanize this, my good man.
466	Bart Simpson	All those coins were only worth three lousy cents?
467	Homer Simpson	Oh, this is so humiliating... I feel like such a geek.
468	Bart Simpson	How's it going, Bart?
469	Homer Simpson	Ah ha, now you look pathetic.
471	Homer Simpson	Beat it.
472	Bart Simpson	Ugh, my dog ate it.
473	Homer Simpson	So long, officers. Uh-oh.
