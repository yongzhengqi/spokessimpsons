# spokessimpsons - web - frontend

## Introduction

We use flutter web to write our frontend. I used flutter to write mobile apps. And it works basiclly butifully fine. But, flutter web, emmmm, well, it does is in early beta test.

## Getting Started

1. Run `flutter build web`. And generated content will be stored at `build/web`.
2. Copy all the file inside `build/web` to your server. Config Nginx.
3. Open your browser and enjoy it. ;)
